From January until about a month and a half ago , I was mostly off of Learn.co. School, work and health issues made it difficult to spend time doing Learn. I have to some extent, relearned both Rails and Javascript. Part of it was that switching to the React track made me feel like I was set back. It was frustrating to have lost some of the knowledge I had but now I am back and ready to finish the program. 

After going through Rails and Javascript, and the unit that combines them, I made some improvements to the app I made for my Rails assessment many months ago. I was dreading doing this the whole time I was re-learning but when I finally got to it, I enjoyed the process of using Javascript and AJAX to make the site more dynamic and reduce page refreshers. 

Going into the project, one feature I had an idea that I would like to change was the experience of taking a questionnaire. I ended up making other improvements and I tried for many hours to make this one in particular but a combination of how complex the Rails code had been and having to re-write the whole thing meant I am leaving this for a future project, perhaps when I am polishing my portfolio entries. 

Some improvements I did make were the ability to add more than one question when creating a questionnaire, having AJAX for an index page and a show page for questionnaire results. I found a few bugs in the rails code as well. I'm really looking forward to React and Redux.
