I started learning to code at the beginning of March of 2016. I've learned so much in what will soon be a year, and I'm so excited to keep learning for years to come. I've noticed a pattern in myself that I can imagine is common to new programmers. I'm not talking about "writing the code I wish I had" and building programs top-down in that way, but writing programs that I think should be right and because they function under the most basic parameters or just one set of test cases, my wishful thinking leads me to believe or hope that without testing my code extensively, it will work for all test cases.

This is obviously not too good a practice to employ but the reason I'm writing this article is because I'm starting to realize and notice when I'm 'wishfully coding' and ask myself: how could I be holding this code to the highest standards possible by testing all the edge cases and the extreme cases and questioning my logic. Maybe I was able to skirt by becuase my intuition is pretty good when it comes to doing things right the first time, but this is not reliable by any means. 

I had a dose of reality when I took part in a worldwide competitive programming event called IEEE Xtreme last fall. My team and I did not do too well. When I look back on how I approached the many problems the competition had to throw at me, first of all, I began coding too quickly, not giving myself a chance to analyze the program, and come up with tests to drive my programming, and I gave up too easily. As I have diven deep into data structures and algorithms lately, I've been tested to come up with programs that work for a wide array of test cases and to iterate to harder and harder conditions.

I'll keep working on this and try to analyze what solution would be best before jumping into the implementation.
